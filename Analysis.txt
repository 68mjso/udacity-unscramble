# Task 0:

- Time complexity: O(1)
- Reason: Only take the first and last element of the array

# Task 1:

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Reason: We're using 2 loop for texts and calls so the time complexity should be O(2n) = O(n)

# Task 2:

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Reason: We're using 1 loop for calls so the time complexity should be O(n)

# Task 3:

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Reason: The bigger loop using here is loop for calls so the time complexity should be O(n)

# Task 4:

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Reason: The bigger loop using here is loop for calls so the time complexity should be O(n)
